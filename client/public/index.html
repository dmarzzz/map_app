      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

    React Notes : https://reactjs.org/docs/rendering-elements.html
    We call this a “root” DOM node because everything inside it will be managed by React DOM.
    Applications built with just React usually have a single root DOM node. If you are integrating React into an existing app, you may have as many isolated root DOM nodes as you like.
    To render a React element into a root DOM node, pass both to ReactDOM.render()

    In index.js we pass root in ReactDOM.render()
